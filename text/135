met, and the master irritated at seeing him
clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep
his promise to Mrs. Linton shoved him back
with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph
"keep the fellow out of the room--send him
into the garret till dinner is over. He'll be
cramming his fingers in the tarts, and stealing
the fruit, if left alone with them a minute."

"Nay, sir," I could not avoid answering,
"he'll touch nothing, not he----and, I suppose,
he must have his share of the dainties as well
as we."

"He shall have his share of my hand, if I
catch him down stairs again till dark," cried
Hindley. "Begone, you Vagabond! What,
you are attempting the coxcomb, are you?
Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks--see
if I won't pull them a bit longer!"

"They are long enough already," observed
Master Linton, peeping from the door-way,
"I wonder they don't make his head-ache.
It's like a colt's mane over his eyes!"
