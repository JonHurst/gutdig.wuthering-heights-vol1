hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness
of the evening.

"You should not have come out," she said,
rising and reaching from the chimney piece two
of the painted canisters.

Her position before was sheltered from the
light: now, I had a distinct view of her
whole figure and countenance. She was slender,
and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an ad-
mirable form, and the most exquisite little face
that I have ever had the pleasure of behold-
ing: small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets,
or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate
neck; and eyes--had they been agreeable in
expression, they would have been irresistible-
fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only
sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn
and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural
to be detected there.

The canisters were almost out of her reach;
I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon
me as a miser might turn, if any one at-
tempted to assist him in counting his gold.
