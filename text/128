hand, as a christmas box: and, from that, I
went on to think of' his fondness for Heathcliff',
and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after
death had removed him; and that naturally
led me to consider the poor lad's situation
now, and from singing I changed my mind to
crying. It struck me soon, however, there
would be more sense in endeavouring to repair
some of his wrongs than shedding tears over
them--I got up and walked into the court to
seek him.

He was not far, I found him smoothing the
glossy coat of the new pony in the stable,
and feeding the other beasts, according to
custom.

"Make haste, Heathcliff!" I said "the
kitchen is so comfortable--and Joseph is up-
stairs; make haste, and let me dress you smart
before Miss Cathy comes out--and then you
can sit together, with the whole hearth to
yourselves, and have a long chatter till bed-
time."
