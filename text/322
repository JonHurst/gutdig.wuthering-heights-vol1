arrangement from living alone with him; but
he knew the people we were coming amongst:
and he did not fear their intermeddling.

I sat and thought a doleful time; the clock
struck eight, and nine, and still my companion
paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast,
and perfectly silent, unless a groan, or a bitter
ejaculation forced itself out at intervals.

I listened to detect a woman's voice in the
house, and filled the interim with wild regrets,
and dismal anticipations, which, at last, spoke
audibly in irrepressible sighing, and weeping.

I was not aware how openly I grieved, till
Earnshaw halted opposite, in his measured
walk, and gave me a stare of newly awakened
surprise. Taking advantage of his recovered
attention, I exclaimed--

"I'm tired with my journey, and I want to
go to bed! Where is the maid-servant?
Direct me to her, as she wont come to to me I"

"We have none," he answered; "you must
wait on yourself!"
