"Oh, wicked, wicked I" gasped the elder,
"may the Lord deliver us from evil!"

"No, reprobate! you are a castaway--be
off", or I'll hurt you seriously! I'll have you
all modlled in wax and clay; and the first who
passes the limits, I fix, shall--I'll not say
what he shall be done to--but, you'll see! Go,
I'm looking at you!"

The little witch put a mock malignity into
her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with
sincere horror, hurried out praying and ejacu-
lating "wicked" as he went.

I thought her conduct must be prompted
by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we
were alone I endeavoured to interest her in
my distress.

"Mrs. Heathcliff," I said, earnestly, "you
must excuse me for troubling you--I presume,
because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot
help being good-hearted. Do point out some
landmarks by which I may know my way home
--I have no more idea how to get there than
you would have how to get to London!"
