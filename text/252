square head bent forward, and his little hand
scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.

"Poor Hindley!" I exclaimed, involuntarily.

I started--my bodily eye was cheated into a
momentary belief that the child lifted its face
and stared straight into mine! It vanished in
a twinkling; but, immediately, I felt an irre-
sistible yearning to be at the Heights. Super-
stition urged me to comply with this impulse-
supposing he should be dead! I thought--or
should die soon!--supposing it were a sign of
death!

The nearer I got to the house the more agi-
tated I grew: and on catching sight of it, I
trembled every limb. The apparition had out-
stripped me; it stood looking through the
gate. That was my first idea on observing an
elf'-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy
countenance against the bars. Further reflec-
tion suggested this must be Hareton, my Hare-
ton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten
months since.
