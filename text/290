struck the table-top! I swept it along the
carpet, and then, memory burst in--my late
anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of des-
pair--I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretch-
ed--it must have been temporary derangement
for there is scarcely cause--But, supposing at
twelve years old, I had been wrenched from
the Heights, and every early association, and
my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time,
and been converted, at a stroke into Mrs.
Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and
the wife of a stranger; an exile, and outcast,
thenceforth, from what had been my world--
You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where
I grovelled! Shake your head, as you will,
Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You
should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you
should, and compelled him to leave me quiet!
Oh, I'm burning! I wish I were out of doors
-I wish I were a girl again, half savage and
hardy, and free... and laughing at injuries, not
maddening under them! Why am I so
