"Yes, Miss," I replied.

She entered and approached the hearth. I,
supposing she was going to say something,
looked up. The expression of her face seem-
ed disturbed and anxious. Her lips were
half asunder as if she meant to speak; and
she drew a breath, but it escaped in a sigh,
instead of a sentence.

I resumed my song: not having forgotten
her recent behaviour.

"Where's Heathcliff?" she said, interrupt-
ing me.

"About his work in the stable," was my
answer.

He did not contradict me; perhaps, he had
fallen into a dose.

There followed another long pause, during
which I perceived a drop or two trickle from
Catherine's cheek to the flags.

Is she sorry for her shameful conduct? I
asked myself. That will be a novelty, but, she
may come to the point as she will--I shan't
help her!
