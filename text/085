days of his absence---and often did little Cathy
ask when he would be home: Mrs. Earnshaw,
expected him by supper-time, on the third
evening; and she put the meal off hour after
hour; there were no signs of his coming, how-
ever, and at last the children got tired of run-
ning down to the gate to look--Then it grew
dark, she would have had them to bed, but
they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up;
and, just about eleven o'clock, the door-latch
was raised quietly and in stept the master.
He threw himself into a chair, laughing and
groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was
nearly killed--he would not have such another
walk for the three kingdoms.

"And at the end of it, to be flighted to
death!" he said opening his great coat, which
he held bundled up in his arms," See here,
wife; I was never so beaten with anything in
my life; but you must e'en take it as a gift
of God; though it's as dark almost as if it
came from the devil."
