saw a servant-girl on her knees, surrounded by
brushes, and coal--scuttles; and raising an in-
ternal dust as she extinguished the flames with
heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me
back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a
four miles walk, arrived at Heathcliff's garden
gate just in time to escape the first feathery
flakes of a snow shower.

On that bleak hill top the earth was hard
with a black frost, and the air made me shiver
through every limb. Being unable to remove
the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the
flagged causeway bordered with straggling
gooseberry bushes, knocked vainly for admit-
tance, till my knuckles tingled, and the dogs
howled.

"Wretched inmates!" I ejaculated, men-
tally, "you deserve perpetual isolation from
your species for your churlish inhospitality.
At least, I would not keep my doors barred

in the day time--I don't care--I will get in!"
