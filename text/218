tion about the candles, when a sense of my
folly compelled me to return, and mutter:

"A person from Gimmerton wishes to see
you, ma'am."

"What does he want?" asked Mrs. Linton.

"I did not question him," I answered.

"Well, close the curtains, Nelly," she said;
"and bring up tea. I'll be back again di-
rectly."

She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar in-
quired carelessly, who it was?

"Some one the mistress does not expect,"
I replied. "That Heathcliff", you recollect
him, sir, who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's."

"What, the gipsy--the plough-boy?" he
cried. "Why did you not say so to Cathe-
rine?"

"Hush! you must not call him by those
names, master," I said. "She'd be sadly
grieved to hear you. She was nearly heart-
broken when he ran off; I guess his return
will make a jubilee to her."
