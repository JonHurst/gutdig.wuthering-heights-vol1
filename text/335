The adjective our gave mortal offence. He
swore it was not, nor ever should be mine; and
he'd-but I'll not repeat his-language, nor des-
cribe his habitual conduct; he is ingenious and
unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I
sometimes wonder at him with an intensity
that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a
tiger, or a venomous serpent could not rouse
terror in me equal to that which he wakens.
He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused
my brother of causing it; promising that I
should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he
could get a hold of him.

"I do hate him--I am wretched--
I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one
breath of this to any one at the Grange. I
shall expect you every day--don't disappoint
me!

"ISABELLA."
