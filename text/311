nearly melted snow--Edgar, is there not a
south Wind, and is not the snow almost gone?"

"The snow is quite gone; down here, dar-
ling!" replied her husband, "and I only see
two white spots on the whole range of moors-
The sky is blue, and the larks are singing, and the
becks and brooks are all brim full. Catherine;
last spring at this time, I was longing to have
you under this roof'--now, I wish you were a
mile or two up those bills, the air blows so
sweetly, I feel that it would cure you."

"I shall never be there, but once more!'
said the invalid; "and then you'll leave me,
and I shall remain, for ever. Next spring
you'll long again to have me under this roof,
and you'll look back and think you were happy
today."

Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses,
and tried to cheer her by the fondest words;
but vaguely regarding the flowers, she let
the tears collect on her lashes, and stream
down her cheeks unheeding.
