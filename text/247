purpose of mitigating her adoration. But
don't notice it further. I Wished to punish
her sauciness, that's all--I like her too well,
my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize
and devour her up."

"And I like her too ill to attempt it," said
he, "except in a very ghoulish fashion. You'd
hear of odd things, if I lived alone With that
mawkish, waxen face; the most ordinary would
be painting on its white the colours of the
rainbow, and turning the blue eyes, black,
every day or two; they detestably resemble
Linton's."

"Delectably," observed Catherine. "They
are dove's eyes-angel's!"

"She's her brother's heir, is she not?" he
asked, after a brief silence.

"I should be sorry to think so," returned
his companion. "Half-a-dozen nephews shall
erase her title, please Heaven! Abstract your
mind from the subject, at present--you are too
prone to covet your neighbour's goods: re-
member this neighbour's goods are mine."
