CHAPTER X.

A CHARMING introduction to a hermit's life!
Four Weeks' torture, tossing and sickness!
Oh, these bleak winds, and bitter, northern
skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory coun-
try surgeons! And, oh, this dearth of the
human physiognomy, and, worse than all, the
terrible intimation of Kenneth that I need not
expect to be out of doors till spring!

Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a
call. About seven days ago he sent me a
brace of grouse--the last of the season.
