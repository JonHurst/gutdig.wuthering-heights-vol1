I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter;
hut Joseph asked what we could be thinking
of to roar in that way over a saint in Heaven.

He told me to put on my cloak and run to
Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson. I
could not guess the use that either would be
of, then. However, I went, through wind and
rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with
me; the other said he would come in the
morning.

Leaving Joseph to explain matters, I ran
to the children's room; their door was ajar, I
saw they had never laid down, though it was
past midnight; but they were calmer, and did
not need me to console them. The little souls
were comforting each other with better
thoughts than I could have hit on; no parson
in the world ever pictured Heaven so beauti-
fully as they did, in their innocent talk; and,
while I sobbed, and listened, I could not help
wishing we were all there safe together.
