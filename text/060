branch: instead of which, my fingers closed on
the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!

The intense horror of nightmare came over
me; I tried to draw back my arm, but, the
hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice,
sobbed,

"Let me in--let me in!"

"Who are you?" I asked struggling, mean-
while, to disengage myself.

"Catherine Linton," it replied, shiveringly,
(why did I think of Linton? I had read Earn-
shaw, twenty times for Linton) "I'm come
home, I'd lost my way on the moor!"

As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's
face looking through the window--Terror
made me cruel; and, finding it useless to at-
tempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its
wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to
and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the
bed-clothes: still it wailed, "Let me in!" and
maintained its tenacious gripe, almost madden-
ing me with fear.
