doing there, Nelly?"

"My work, Miss," I replied. (Mr. Hindley
had given me directions to make a third party
in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)

She stepped behind me and whispered cross-
ly, "Take yourself and your dusters off!
when company are in the house, servants
don't commence scouring and cleaning in the
room where they are!"

"It's a good opportunity, now that master
is away," I answered aloud, "he hates me to
be fidgetting over these things in his presence
-I'm sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me."

"I hate you to be fidgetting in my pre-
sence," exclaimed the young lady imperiously,
not allowing her guest time to speak-she had
failed to recover her equanimity since the little
dispute with Heathcliff.

"Pm sorry for it, Miss Catherine I" was my
response; and I proceeded assiduously with
my occupation.
