Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, col-
lected sufficient wit to recognise her. They
see us at church, you know, though we sel-
dom meet them elsewhere."

"That's Miss Earnshaw!" he whispered to
his mother, "and look how Skulker has bitten
her--how her foot bleeds!"

"Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!" cried the
dame, "Miss Earnshaw scouring the country
with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child
is in mourning--surely it is--and she may be
lamed for life!"

"What culpable carelessness in her bro-
ther!" exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from
me to Catherine. "I've understood from
Shielders (that was the curate sir) that he lets
her grow up in absolute heathenism. But
who is this? Where did she pick up this com-
panion? Oho! I declare lie is that strange
acquisition my late neighbour made in his
journey to Liverpool--a little Lascar, or an
American or Spanish castaway."
