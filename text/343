I would have died by inches before I touched
a single hair of his head!"

"And yet, I interrupted, you have no scru-
ples in completely ruining all hopes of her per-
fect restoration, by thrusting yourself in to
her remembrance, now, when she has nearly
forgotten you, and involving her in a new tu-
mult of discord, and distress."

"You suppose she has nearly forgotten
me?" he said. "Oh Nelly! you know she
has not! You know as well as I do, that for
every thought she spends on Linton, she
spends a thousand on me! At a most misera-
ble period of my life, I had a notion of the
kind, it haunted me on my return to the
neighbourhood, last summer, but only her own
assurance, could make me admit' the horrible
idea again. And then, Linton would be no-
thing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that
ever I dreamt. Two words would comprehend
my future death and hell--existence, after losing
her would be hell.
