if left to herself, or persevered in nursing it
perpetually, I cannot say; she had little time
to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-
meeting at the next town; my master was
obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of
his absence, called rather earlier than usual.

Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the
library, on hostile terms, but silent. The lat-
ter alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the
disclosure she had made of her secret feelings
in a transcient fit of passion; the former, on
mature consideration, really offended with her
companion; and, if she laughed again at her
pertness, inclined to make it no laughing mat-
ter to her.

She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass
the window. I was sweeping the hearth, and
I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips. Isa-
bella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book,
remained till the door opened, and it was too
late to attempt an escape, which she would
gladly have done had it been practicable.
