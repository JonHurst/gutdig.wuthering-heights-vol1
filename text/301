herself up. Afterwards, she refused to eat,
and now she alternately raves, and remains in
a half dream, knowing those about her, but
having her mind filled with all sorts of strange
ideas and illusions."

"Mr. Linton will be sorry?" observed Ken-
neth, interrogatively.

"Sorry? he'll break his heart should any-
thing happen!" I replied. "Don't alarm him
more than necessary."

"Well, I told him to beware," said my com-
panion, "and he must bide the consequences
of neglecting my warning! Hasn't he been
thick with Mr. Heathcliff lately?"

"Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,"
answered I, "though more on the strength of
the mistress having known him when a boy,
than because the master likes his company.
At present, he's discharged from the trouble of
calling; owing to some presumptuous aspira-
tions after Miss Linton which he manifested.
I hardly think he'll be taken in again."
