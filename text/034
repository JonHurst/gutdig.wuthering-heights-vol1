favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy," I
remarked, turning to my neighbour.

This was worse than before: the youth grew
crimson, and clenched his fist with every ap-
pearance of a meditated assault. But he
seemed to recollect himself, presently; and
smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered
on my behalf, which, however, I took care not
to notice."

"Unhappy in your conjectures, sir!" ob-
served my host; "we neither of us have the
privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate
is dead. I said she was my daughter-in-law,
therefore, she must have married my son."

"And this young man is--"

"Not my son, assuredly!"

Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather
too hold a jest to attribute the paternity of
that bear to him.--

"My name is Hareton Earnshaw," growled
the other; "and I'd counsel you to respect
it!"
