seeming to have got into his head the notion
that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and
longed to do him an ill-turn.

It was a disadvantage to the lad, for the
kinder among us did not wish to fret the mas-
ter, so we humoured his partiality; and that
humouring was rich nourishment to the child's
pride and black tempers. Still it became in a
manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley's
manifestations of scorn, while his father was
near, roused the old man to a fury. He seized
his stick to strike him, and shook with rage
that he could not do it.

At last, our curate, (we had a curate then
who made the living answer by teaching the
little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his
bit of land himself,) he advised that the young
man should be sent to college, and Mr. Earn-
shaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he
said--

"Hindley was naught, and would never
thrive as where he wandered."
