large and small--Catherine Earnshaw; here
and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff, and
then again to Catherine Linton."

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against
the window, and continued spelling over
Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till
my eyes closed; but they had not rested five
minutes when a glare of white letters started
from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air
swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself
to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered my
candle wick reclining on one of the antique
volumes, and perfuming the place with an
odour of roasted calf-skin.

I snuffed it off', and, very ill at ease, under
the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat
up, and spread open the injured tome on my
knee. It Was a Testament, in lean type, and
smelling dreadfully musty: a y-leaf bore the
inscription--"Catherine Earnshaw, her book,"
and a date some quarter of a century back.
