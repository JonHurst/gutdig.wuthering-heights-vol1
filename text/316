thoughts, except at the moment when I miss
them--I should laugh and dance for joy, if I
found their absence was the total of my mise-
ries, and the rest was an unnatural dream!

The sun set behind the Grange, as we
turned on to the moors; by that, I judged it
to be six o'clock; and my companion halted
half-an-hour, to inspect the park, and the
gardens, and, probably, the place itself', as
well as he could; so it was dark when we
dismounted in the paved yard of the farm-
house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph,
issued out-to receive us by the light of a dip
candle. He did it with a courtesy that re-
dounded to his credit. His first act was to
elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint
malignantly, project his under lip, and turn
away.

Then he took the two horses, and led them
into the stables; reappearing for the purpose
of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in an
ancient castle.
