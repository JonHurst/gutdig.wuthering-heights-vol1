His countenance was much older in expression,
and decision of feature than Mr. Linton's; it
looked intelligent, and retained no marks of
former degradation. A half-civilized ferocity
lurked yet in the depressed brows, and eyes
full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his
manner was even dignified, quite divested of
roughness though too stern for grace.

My master's surprise equalled or exceeded
mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how
to address the ploughboy, as he had called
him; Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and
stood looking at him coolly till he chose to
speak.

"Sit down, sir," he said, at length. "Mrs.
Linton, recalling old times, would have me
give you a cordial reception, and, of course, I
am gratified when anything occurs to please
her."

"And I also," answered Heathcliff," espe-
cially if it be anything in which I have a
part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly."
