I descended and found Heathcliff waiting
under the porch, evidently anticipating an in-
vitation to enter. He followed my guidance
without waste of words, and I ushered him
into the presence of the master and mistress,
whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm

feeling when her friend appeared at the door;
she sprang forward, took both his hands, and
led him to Linton; and then she seized Lin-
ton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into
his.

Now fully revealed by the fire and candle-
light, I was amazed, more than ever, to behold
the transformation of Heathcliff. He had
grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; be-
side whom, my master seemed quite slender
and youth-like. His upright carriage sug-
gested the idea of his having been in the army.
