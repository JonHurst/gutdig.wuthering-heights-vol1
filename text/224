me!" he murmured. "I heard of your mar-
riage, Cathy, not long since; and, while wait-
ing in the yard below, I meditated this plan-
just to have one glimpse of your face--a stare
of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure;
afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and
then prevent the law by doing execution on
myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out
of my mind; but beware of meeting me with
another aspect next time! Nay, you'll not drive
me off again--~ you were really sorry for me, were
you? Well, there was cause. I've fought
through a bitter life since I last heard your
voice, and you must forgive me, for I struggled
only for you!"

"Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea,
please to come to the table," interrupted Lin-
ton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and
a due measure of politeness. "Mr. Heath-
cliff will have a long walk, wherever he may
lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty."
