bed in the long hours. One or two is early
enough for a person who lies till ten."

"You shouldn't lie till ten. There's the
very prime of the morning gone long before
that time. A person who has not done one
half his day's work by ten o'clock, runs a
chance of leaving the other half undone."

"Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your
chair; because to-morrow I intend lengthen-
ing the night till afternoon. I prognosticate
for myself an obstinate cold, at least."

"I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me
to leap over some three years, during that
space, Mrs. Earnshaw--"

"No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort!
Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in
which, if you were seated alone, and the cat
licking its kitten on the rug before you, you
would watch the operation so intently that
puss's neglect of one ear would put you seri-
ously out of temper?"

"A terribly lazy mood, I should say."
