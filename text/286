her frame, and she would keep straining her
gaze towards the glass.

"There's nobody here!" I insisted. "It was
yourself, Mrs. Linton; you knew it a while
since."

"Myself," she gasped, "and the clock is
striking twelve! It's true then; that's dread-
ful!"

Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gath-
ered them over her eyes. I attempted to steal
to the door with an intention of calling her
husband; but I was summoned back by a pierc-
ing shriek. The shawl had dropped from the
frame.

"Why what is the matter?" cried I. "Who
is coward now? Wake up! That is the glass
--the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see your-
self in it, and there am I too by your side."

Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast,
but the horror gradually passed from her coun-
tenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of
shame.
