besides, I felt loath to yield the fellow further
amusement, at my expense; since his humour
took that turn.

He--probably swayed by prudential consider-
ations of the folly of offending a good tenant
--relaxed, a little, in the laconic style of chip-
ping of his pronouns, and auxiliary verbs; and
introduced, what he supposed would be a sub-
ject of interest to me, a discourse on the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of my present place
of retirement.

I found him very intelligent on the topics we
touched; and, before I went home, I was en-
couraged so far as to volunteer another visit,
to-morrow.

He evidently wished no repetition of my in-
trusion. I shall go, notwithstanding. It is
astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared
with him.
