"By no means; you must say why?"

to be with."

"Bad," was my commentary.

"And because he is young and cheerful."

"Bad, still."

"And, because he loves me."

"Indifferent, coming there."

"And he will be rich, and I shall like to be
the greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and
I shall be proud of having such a husband."

"Worst of all! And, now, say how you love
him?"

"As every body loves--You're silly, Nelly."

"Not at all--Answer."
