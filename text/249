ing Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heath-
cliff, quietly, leaving us as We had been prior
to his advent. His visits were a continual
nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my
master also. His abode at the Heights was
an oppression past explaining. I felt that God
had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own
wicked Wanderings, and an evil beast prowled
between it and the fold, waiting his time to
spring and destroy.
