bride just out of the honeymoon. I'll read it,
for I keep it yet. Any relic of the dead is
precious, if they were valued living.

"DEAR ELLEN," it begins.

"I came, last night, to Wuthering Heights,
and heard, for the first time, that Catherine
has been, and is yet, very ill. I must not
write to her I suppose, and my brother is ei-
ther too angry, or too distressed to answer
what I send him. Still, I must write to some-
body, and the only choice left me is you.

Inform Edgar that I'd give the World to see
his face again--that my heart returned to
Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours
after I left it, and is there at this moment, full
of warm feelings for him, and Catherine! I
can't follow it though--(those words are under-
lined) they need not expect me, and they may
draw what conclusions they please; taking
care however, to lay nothing at the door of
my weal will, or deficient affection.
