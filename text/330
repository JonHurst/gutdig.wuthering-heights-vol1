"I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not lodge at
the top of the house, does he?"

"Oh I it's Maister Hathecliff's yah're went-
ing?" cried he, as if' making a new discovery.
"Couldn't ye uh said sea, at onst? un then,
aw mud uh telled ye, baht all this wark, ut
that's just one yah cannut sea--he allas keeps
it locked, un' nob'dy iver mells on't but his-
seln."

"You've a nice house, Joseph," I could not
refrain from observing, "and pleasant inmates;
and I think the concentrated essence of all the
madness in the World took up its abode in my
brain the day I linked my fate with theirs!
However that is not to the present purpose--
there are other rooms. For heaven's sake, be
quick, and let me settle somewhere!"

He made no reply to this adjuration; only
plodding doggedly down the wooden steps, and
halting before an apartment which, from that
halt, and the superior quality of its furniture,
I conjectured to be the best one.
