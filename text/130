moors; not re-appearing till the family were
departed for church. Fasting, and reflection
seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.
He hung about me, for a while, and having
screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly,

"Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be
good."

"High time, Heathcliff," I said, "you have
grieved Catherine; she's sorry she ever came
home, I dare say! It looks as if you envied
her, because she is more thought of than
you."

The notion of envying Catherine was in-
comprehensible to him, but the notion of griev-
ing her, he understood clearly enough.

"Did she say she was grieved?" he inquired
looking very serious.

"She cried when I told her you were off
again this morning."

"Well, I cried last night" he returned,
"and I had more reason to cry than she."
