up a large int.

added, guessing from the action that Nelly, if
she lived in his memory at all, was not recog-
nised as one with me.

He raised his missile to hurl it; I com-
menced a soothing speech, but could not stay
his hand. The stone struck my bonnet, and
then ensued, from the stammering lips of the
little fellow, a string of curses which, whether
he comprehended them or not, were delivered
with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby
features into a shocking expression of malig-
nity.

You may be certain this grieved, more
than angered me. Fit to cry, I took an
orange from my pocket, and offered it to pro-
pitiate him.
